vim-stuff
=========

Heavily dependent on Vundle (https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

You will also need a patched font for the powerline (https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/wiki/Patched-fonts)

Install vundle, symlink vimrc to ~/.vimrc and run:
    :BundleInstall

hopefully that should all work.
