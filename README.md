vim-stuff
=========

Heavily dependent on Vundle (https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

You will also need a patched font for the powerline (https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts)

Tagbar is dependent on exuberant C-Tags
Ultisnips is dependent on python
Ack is dependent on ack-grep
clang_complete is dependent on libclang


Install vundle, symlink vimrc to ~/.vimrc and run:
    :BundleInstall

hopefully that should all work.
